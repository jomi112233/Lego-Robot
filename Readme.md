# LEGO Line-Following Robot

## Overview

This project is a school assignment to build a LEGO robot that can:

- Follow a line autonomously
- Detect and avoid obstacles
- Return to the line after avoiding obstacles

Our focus is on combining sensor input, motor control, and smart navigation to create a smooth and reliable robot.

## Goals

- Implement accurate line-following using sensors
- Design obstacle detection and avoidance logic
- Ensure seamless re-entry onto the line after detours
